        <p>Hermione Granger is a fictional character from The Harry Potter series. She is my favortie character because she brave,intelligent,kind,loving,forgving.Hermione stood by Harry through everything.She even stood by him when his best freind Ron didn't. Hemione helped Harry hunted down the horcruxes.Without Hermione,Ron and Harry would have died a millon times. Even when she was torued she didn't stop helping the hunt for horcruxes.</p>
